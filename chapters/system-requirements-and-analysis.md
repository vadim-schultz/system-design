# System Requirements and Analysis

## System Requirements Gathering

System requirements gathering is the process of identifying, collecting, and documenting the requirements of a system. It is a critical step in the system design process, as it lays the foundation for the entire project. The goal of requirements gathering is to understand the needs and expectations of stakeholders, users, and the business, and to define a clear set of requirements that meet those needs.

## Types of System Requirements

There are three main types of system requirements:

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe what the system must do, or the tasks it must perform. They define the system's behavior, functionality, and features. Examples of functional requirements include:

*   User authentication and authorization
*   Data storage and retrieval
*   Calculations and processing
*   User interface and user experience
    

### Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe how the system should perform, or the quality attributes it should possess. They define the system's performance, scalability, security, and usability. Examples of non-functional requirements include:

*   Response time and throughput
*   System availability and uptime
*   Data security and encryption
*   User experience and usability

### Constraints

Constraints are limitations or restrictions that affect the system's design and implementation. They can be related to technology, budget, timeline, or other factors. Examples of constraints include:

*   Limited budget or resources
*   Tight project timeline
*   Existing technology or infrastructure
*   Regulatory or compliance requirements

## Requirements Gathering Techniques

There are several techniques used to gather system requirements:

### Interviews

Interviews involve one-on-one or group discussions with stakeholders, users, and subject-matter experts. They can be structured or unstructured, and are useful for gathering detailed, qualitative information.

### Surveys

Surveys involve collecting information through questionnaires or online forms. They are useful for gathering quantitative data and opinions from a large number of people.

### Use Cases

Use cases describe the interactions between the system and its users. They provide a detailed, step-by-step description of how the system will be used, and are useful for identifying functional and non-functional requirements.

### Focus Groups

Focus groups involve facilitated discussions with a small, diverse group of people. They are useful for gathering feedback and opinions on specific topics or prototypes.

### Observation

Observation involves watching users interact with the system or similar systems. It is useful for gathering information on user behavior and identifying areas for improvement.

### Prototyping

Prototyping involves creating a mock-up or working model of the system. It is useful for gathering feedback and testing assumptions about the system's design and functionality.

### Document Analysis

Document analysis involves reviewing existing documents, such as business plans, technical specifications, and user manuals. It is useful for gathering information on the system's context and requirements.

These are just a few of the techniques used in system requirements gathering. The choice of technique depends on the project's goals, timeline, and stakeholders.

## System Analysis and Modeling

System analysis and modeling is the process of studying and representing a system's behavior, structure, and relationships to understand its requirements and design. It involves using various techniques and tools to analyze the system, identify its components, and model its behavior.

### System Modeling Techniques

System modeling techniques are used to create visual representations of the system, making it easier to understand and communicate its behavior and structure. Some common system modeling techniques include:

### Unified Modeling Language (UML)

UML is a standardized language for modeling systems. It provides a set of diagrams and notations to represent the system's structure, behavior, and interactions. UML diagrams include:

*   Class diagrams: show the system's classes, attributes, and relationships
*   Use case diagrams: show the system's functionality and interactions with users
*   Sequence diagrams: show the system's behavior over time
*   State machine diagrams: show the system's states and transitions

### Flowcharts

Flowcharts are graphical representations of the system's workflow, showing the sequence of steps and decisions involved in a process. They are useful for modeling business processes, algorithms, and system logic.

### Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)

DFDs show the flow of data through the system, highlighting the inputs, processing, and outputs. They are useful for modeling data-intensive systems and identifying data dependencies.

## System Analysis Tools

System analysis tools are used to gather and analyze requirements, identify system components, and model system behavior. Some common system analysis tools include:

### Use Cases

Use cases describe the system's functionality and interactions with users. They provide a detailed, step-by-step description of how the system will be used, and are useful for identifying functional and non-functional requirements.

### User Stories

User stories are brief, informal descriptions of the system's functionality from the user's perspective. They provide a concise way to capture requirements and are often used in agile development methodologies.

### System Context Diagrams

System context diagrams show the system's boundaries, interfaces, and relationships with external entities. They provide a high-level view of the system's context and are useful for identifying system components and interactions.

### Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)

ERDs show the relationships between entities, such as users, data, and systems. They are useful for modeling data structures and identifying data relationships.

### Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)

BPMN is a standardized language for modeling business processes. It provides a set of diagrams and notations to represent the system's workflow, activities, and interactions.

### System Architecture Diagrams

System architecture diagrams show the system's high-level architecture, including components, interfaces, and relationships. They provide a comprehensive view of the system's design and are useful for identifying system components and interactions.

These are just a few of the system analysis and modeling techniques and tools used in system design. The choice of technique or tool depends on the project's goals, complexity, and stakeholders.
